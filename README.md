## "Next.js Learning Project: Web Application Development"

In this project, I am learning Next.js at a beginner level. I need to create a web application using Next.js and its capabilities. The project involves developing various pages such as the home page, post page, contact page, and so on.

During the project, I study the basics of Next.js, including static page generation, server-side rendering, and API support. I also apply my web application development skills using React and JavaScript to create interactive features.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of Next.js and apply it in practice. I hope that with the help of this project, I will be able to understand how Next.js can help in web application development and how to utilize its features to create powerful and modern web pages.
